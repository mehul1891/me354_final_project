This folder is the work of David Manosalvas and Mehul Oswal as a course project at Stanford University. This folder contains files 
written to test different filters to sharpen images and to automate the sharpening process for a batch of images 
by choosing optimum filter.

If these files are needed to be used by anyone other than the authors (2), the authors must be notified apriori and acknowledged
later. 
Files may need to be modified to compile correctly. 

For any further information, please contact authors at deman@stanford.edu or moswal@stanford.edu

Thanks,

David & Mehul
