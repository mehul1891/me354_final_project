abstract = {This work presents a perceptual-based no-reference objective image sharpness/blurriness metric by integrating the concept of just noticeable blur into a probability summation model. Unlike existing objective no-reference image sharpness/blurriness metrics, the proposed metric is able to predict the relative amount of blurriness in images with different content. Results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed perceptual-based sharpness metric. These results show that the proposed sharpness metric correlates well with the perceived sharpness being able to predict with high accuracy the relative amount of blurriness in images with different content.},
