abstract = {This work presents a perceptual-based no-reference objective image sharpness/blurriness metric by integrating the concept of just noticeable blur into a probability summation model. Unlike existing objective no-reference image sharpness/blurriness metrics, the proposed metric is able to predict the relative amount of blurriness in images with different content. Results are provided to illustrate the performance of the proposed perceptual-based sharpness metric. These results show that the proposed sharpness metric correlates well with the perceived sharpness being able to predict with high accuracy the relative amount of blurriness in images with different content.},

abstract = {Objective methods for assessing perceptual image quality traditionally attempted to quantify the visibility of errors (differences) between a distorted image and a reference image using a variety of known properties of the human visual system. Under the assumption that human visual perception is highly adapted for extracting structural information from a scene, we introduce an alternative complementary framework for quality assessment based on the degradation of structural information. As a specific example of this concept, we develop a Structural Similarity Index and demonstrate its promise through a set of intuitive examples, as well as comparison to both subjective ratings and state-of-the-art objective methods on a database of images compressed with JPEG and JPEG2000.},
